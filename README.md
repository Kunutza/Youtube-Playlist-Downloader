# Youtube-Playlist-Downloader
This is a script to download all the audio of every video in a youtube playlist. 

It was made in one day so it does not have documentation

Only the main.py file contains code writen by me. All the other files where automatically created be pyinstaller.

Feel free to suggest changes in the code. 

Suggesting changes in the multithreading part of the code would be greatly appreciated as this script was writen so I could practice and get to better understand just that.
