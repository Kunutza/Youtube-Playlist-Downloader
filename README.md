# Youtube-Playlist-Downloader
This is a script to download all the audio of every video in a youtube playlist. 

Feel free to suggest changes in the code. 

This project was initially made to practice multithreading. You can borrow all the code you want

## Version 1.1
- Finds video streams using multithread
- Downloads the best quality of audio automatically
- Prints out the size of the download before proceeding

## Version 1.2
- fixed searching bug
- asks to download video or audio
- downloads the mp4 video with the best resolution
- get_audio_stream/get_video_stream Incomplete read exception created

# TODO 
- ask to download video or audio
- starts anyway no matter what the prompt is (add check for youtube url)
- Implement documentation
- give choice about the quality of the audio that is going to be downloaded
- get rid of global variables 

## Late TODO
- make gui
- break down main.py in multiple files
