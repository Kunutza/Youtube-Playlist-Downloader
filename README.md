# Youtube-Playlist-Downloader
This is a script to download all the audio of every video in a youtube playlist. 

It was made in one day so it does not have documentation

Feel free to suggest changes in the code. 

Suggesting changes in the multithreading part of the code would be greatly appreciated as this script was writen so I could practice and get to better understand just that.

# TODO 
- starts anyway no matter what the prompt is
- Implement documentation
- give choice about the quality of the audio that is going to be downloaded
- print out the size of the download for each audio quality
- get rid of global variables 

## Late TODO
- make gui
- break down main.py in multiple files
